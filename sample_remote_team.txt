Remote-First Team Structure - Problem Context

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Evaluate the robustness and sustainability of transitioning to a fully remote-first team structure for a mid-sized software engineering department (50 engineers, distributed across 3 time zones).

TARGET SYSTEM:
The engineering department currently operates on a hybrid model (2 days office, 3 days remote). The organization is considering a full remote-first transition to improve talent retention and access global talent pools.

OBJECTIVES:
- Maintain or improve engineering productivity metrics
- Sustain team cohesion and collaboration quality
- Retain existing high-performing engineers
- Enable effective hiring from global talent pool
- Reduce office-related operational costs by 40%

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must maintain existing product delivery commitments
- Limited budget for remote work infrastructure ($50K)
- Existing lease obligations for 18 months
- Regulatory requirements for data security in remote settings
- Some team members prefer office environment

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT:
- Competitive talent market for software engineers
- Industry trend toward remote work adoption
- Existing collaboration tools (Slack, Zoom, GitHub)
- Established agile development processes
- Strong documentation culture exists

SYSTEM STRUCTURE:
- 5 cross-functional teams (8-12 members each)
- Team leads responsible for daily coordination
- Bi-weekly sprint cycles with remote ceremonies
- Async-first communication patterns emerging
- Quarterly in-person team gatherings budgeted

PROVIDED MATERIALS:
- Current productivity metrics (velocity, cycle time, bug rates)
- Employee satisfaction survey results
- Remote work policy draft
- Infrastructure assessment (VPN, security, equipment)
- Benchmark data from fully remote companies
- Exit interview summaries from recent departures

DECLARED ASSUMPTIONS:
- Productivity can be maintained with proper async practices
- Video calls can effectively replace in-person collaboration
- Time zone differences can be managed through overlap hours
- Team culture will adapt to remote norms
