Analyze the following Target System using the Qualitative Systems Dynamics framework.

PROBLEM CONTEXT MATERIAL:
{context}

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format:

{
  "SystemOverview": "1-2 paragraph narrative describing how the target system operates and its structure",
  "KeyComponents": ["component 1", "component 2", "component 3"],
  "FeedbackLoops": {
    "Reinforcing": ["loop 1", "loop 2"],
    "Balancing": ["loop 1", "loop 2"]
  },
  "Bottlenecks": ["bottleneck 1", "bottleneck 2"],
  "Fragilities": ["fragility 1", "fragility 2"],
  "Assumptions": ["assumption 1", "assumption 2"],
  "Unknowns": ["unknown 1", "unknown 2"]
}

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no bold text, no explanations outside the JSON.

REMEMBER:
- Focus ONLY on understanding system structure, feedback loops, and fragility
- Do NOT make decisions, recommendations, or optimization advice
- Framework disagreement is a valid outcome
- Explicitly state all assumptions and unknowns
- This is a reasoning surface, not an oracle
