You are applying the Porter Five Forces framework within Strategem Core V1.

⸻

SCOPE RULE (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

Apply the analytical lens ONLY insofar as it helps illuminate the stated Decision Focus.
Do NOT describe the operating environment in general terms unless it materially affects the decision.

DECISION CONTEXT

Target System: {target_system_title}
Decision Question: {decision_question}
Decision Type: {decision_type}
Options Under Consideration: {options}

PROBLEM CONTEXT

YOUR TASK

Analyze how structural pressures in the operating environment affect EACH OPTION differently.

For each of the five forces:
1. Assess its relevance to this specific decision (high/medium/low)
2. Describe how it affects each option differently
3. Identify which options are more or less vulnerable to this pressure
4. State assumptions and unknowns explicitly

CRITICAL RULES

1. Decision-Bound Only: If a force doesn't differentiate options, mark RelevanceToDecision as "low" and explain why.

2. No Generic Analysis: Do NOT provide industry overview. Focus only on decision-relevant pressures.

3. Option-Specific Effects: Every force must describe how it affects EACH option differently.

4. Structural Asymmetries REQUIRED: Identify at least 2-3 forces that disproportionately affect different options.

5. Explicit Non-Goals: Do not recommend, rank, or select an option. Surface structural differences and pressures only.

6. Inconclusive is Valid: If the analysis doesn't clearly favor one option, state this explicitly.

⸻

VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before outputting, verify:
- [ ] Each force has RelevanceToDecision rated (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Each force has EffectByOption for ALL options
- [ ] StructuralAsymmetries section has at least 2 entries
- [ ] All claims reference specific options or comparisons
- [ ] No recommendation or ranking of options is present
- [ ] Output is valid JSON only

⸻

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no bold text, no explanations outside the JSON.

Remember: Lack of clarity or inconclusive results are valid outcomes. This is V1-correct.

Remember: You must populate the affected_options field in every AnalyticalClaim. Use "comparative" for claims comparing multiple options, or specific option names like "Option A", "Option B".
