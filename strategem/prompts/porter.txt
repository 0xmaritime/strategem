  },
  "SupplierPower": {

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no bold text, no explanations outside the JSON.

- Do NOT make decisions, recommendations, or investment advice
- Focus ONLY on structural analysis of the operating environment
- Framework disagreement is a valid outcome
- Explicitly state all assumptions and unknowns
