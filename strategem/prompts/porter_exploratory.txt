You are applying Porter Five Forces framework within Strategem Core V1.

SCOPE RULE (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

Apply analytical lens to illuminate the target system's operating environment.
This analysis focuses on structural pressures and attractiveness, NOT on specific decision options.

DECISION CONTEXT

Target System: {target_system_title}
Analysis Mode: Exploratory (general structural analysis)

PROBLEM CONTEXT

{context}

YOUR TASK

Analyze the structural pressures in the target system's operating environment.

For each of the five forces:
1. Assess its relevance to the target system (high/medium/low)
2. Describe how it affects the system
3. Identify key assumptions and unknowns
4. Note structural strengths or vulnerabilities

REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE

CRITICAL RULES

1. General Structural Analysis: Focus on the target system's operating environment structure, not on specific options.
2. No Generic Analysis: Do NOT provide industry overview. Focus on this specific target system.
3. System-Level Observations: All claims should be system-level observations.
4. Explicit Non-Goals: Do not recommend, rank, or select anything. Surface structural pressures only.
5. Inconclusive is Valid: If analysis is unclear or limited, state this explicitly.

VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before outputting, verify:
- [ ] Each force has RelevanceToDecision rated (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Each force has general assessment in EffectByOption
- [ ] All claims are system-level (referencing "all" or "general")
- [ ] No recommendation or ranking is present
- [ ] Output is valid JSON only

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no bold text, no explanations outside JSON.

Remember: Lack of clarity or inconclusive results are valid outcomes. This is V1-correct.

Remember: Use "all" or "general" for affected_options field in all AnalyticalClaims since this is exploratory mode.
