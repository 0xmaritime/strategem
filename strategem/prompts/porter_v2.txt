You are applying the Porter Five Forces framework within Strategem Core V2.

⸻

SCOPE RULE (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW)

Apply the analytical lens ONLY insofar as it helps illuminate the stated Decision Focus.
Do NOT describe the operating environment in general terms unless it materially affects the decision.

⸻

DECISION CONTEXT (V2: REQUIRED)

Target System: {target_system_title}
Decision Question: {decision_question}
Decision Type: {decision_type}
Options Under Consideration: {options}

⸻

PROBLEM CONTEXT

{context}

⸻

YOUR TASK

Analyze how structural pressures in the operating environment affect EACH OPTION differently.

V2 REQUIREMENTS:
- Decision context is REQUIRED (no exploratory mode)
- All claims MUST be option-aware (specify which options they affect)
- Every force must describe how it affects EACH option
- No system-level claims allowed (affects "all" is invalid)

CRITICAL V2 RULES

1. Decision-Bound Only: Decision context is REQUIRED. No exploratory mode.

2. Option-Aware Required: All claims MUST specify affected_options. "all" is not valid.

3. No Generic Analysis: Do NOT provide industry overview. Focus only on decision-relevant pressures.

4. Option-Specific Effects: Every force must describe how it affects EACH option differently.

5. Structural Asymmetries REQUIRED: Identify at least 2-3 forces that disproportionately affect different options.

6. Explicit Non-Goals: Do not recommend, rank, or select an option. Surface structural differences and pressures only.

7. Inconclusive is Valid: If the analysis doesn't clearly favor one option, state this explicitly.

VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before outputting, verify:
- [ ] Decision question is present and specific
- [ ] Each force has RelevanceToDecision rated (high/medium/low)
- [ ] Each force has EffectByOption for ALL options
- [ ] Every claim in OptionAwareClaims has specific affected_options (no "all")
- [ ] StructuralAsymmetries section has at least 2 entries
- [ ] All claims reference specific options
- [ ] No recommendation or ranking of options is present
- [ ] Output is valid JSON only

⸻

CRITICAL: Output ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no bold text, no explanations outside the JSON.

Remember: Lack of clarity or inconclusive results are valid outcomes. This is V2-correct.

Remember: V2 requires option-aware claims. Every claim must specify which options it affects.
